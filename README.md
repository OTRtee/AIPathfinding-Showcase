README – Pathfinding Visualiser (Tony Djikigoue)

Project Description: 
An interactive Unity-based application that visualises BFS and A* pathfinding algorithms. Users can adjust grid size, search speeds, and observe the agent navigating between user-defined start and end tiles.

Controls & Usage:
- Select Start Tile: Press "Start" button, click on a tile
- Select End Tile: Press "End" button, click on a tile
- Reset Grid: Clears the whole grid
- Soft Reset: Keeps grid but removes visualisations
- Run Search: Begins pathfinding with selected algorithm

Sliders – Adjust:
- Grid Width & Height
- Wave Delay (search speed)
- Path Delay (animation speed)
- Toggle Mode – Switch between BFS and A*

How to Run
1) Open the Unity project in Unity 2021.3.x (or your version).
2) Open the scene Main.unity.
3) Press Play in the Editor.
Optionally build to WebGL or Windows for standalone testing.
